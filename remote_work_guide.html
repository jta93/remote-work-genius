    <h1>Remote Work Productivity Guide</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Remote work provides flexibility and autonomy but also requires discipline. This guide offers strategies to help you stay productive, set boundaries and maintain well‑being in a digital environment.</p>
    <h2>Ergonomic Workspace</h2>
    <p>Design your workspace for comfort and health. Ensure your monitor is at eye level, keep your feet flat on the floor and select a chair that supports your lower back. Ergonomic accessories such as wrist rests and standing mats can reduce strain.</p>
    <h2>Time Management</h2>
    <p>Establish a daily routine with clear start and end times. Use techniques like the Pomodoro method to focus on tasks in short bursts with breaks. Prioritise important tasks early in the day and be realistic about your workload.</p>
    <h2>Communication & Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Effective communication is key for remote teams. Use messaging apps like Slack or Teams for quick conversations and video platforms like Zoom for meetings. Establish response time expectations and schedule regular check‑ins with colleagues.</p>
    <h2>Digital Tools</h2>
    <p>Choose software that makes your work easier. Project management tools (e.g., Trello, Asana) help organise tasks, while cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) allow for seamless file sharing. Protect your data with password managers and VPNs.</p>
    <h2>Health & Well‑Being</h2>
    <p>Set boundaries between work and personal life. Take breaks to stretch and move, and schedule time away from screens. Practice mindfulness or meditation to manage stress and maintain focus.</p>
    <h2>Resources & Further Reading</h2>
    <p>Explore books like <em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport and <em>Remote: Office Not Required</em> by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson for deeper insights. Online courses and remote work communities can also provide valuable tips and support.</p>
